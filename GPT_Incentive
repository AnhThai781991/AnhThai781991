# Hi Bro. I'm logistics manager with 11 years experience. My next job is transport manager in logistics company. I want to make a proposal to set up new salary structure for company driver. An idea is about if driver work hard they will earn more salary. It's quite different with old salary structure. Old structure is with fix salary per month and made they so lazy and no motivate. With Vietnam labor law, driver will earn minimum salary per month. And they will earn by trip. More trip more earn. Help me to present to convince my BOD approve and will active asap. the goal is motivate driver do more trip per day. Minimum is 2 trip per day. That's why so hard to design incentive per trip. Maybe first trip rate different second and so on.

Based on your logistics management experience and the goal to motivate drivers for better performance, I'll help you create a compelling proposal for a performance-based salary structure. Here's a comprehensive presentation framework to convince your Board of Directors:

## Executive Summary

The current fixed salary model creates complacency and fails to incentivize productivity. This proposal introduces a **minimum base salary plus trip-based incentive structure** that complies with Vietnam Labor Law while directly linking driver earnings to performance, aiming to increase daily trips from current levels to a minimum of 2 trips per day.[^1][^2]

## Current Market Context

### Vietnam Legal Requirements

- **Regional minimum wage 2025**: VND 4,960,000/month (USD \$195) for Region I (Ho Chi Minh City area)
- **Driver market salary**: Average VND 71,400,600/year (approximately VND 5.95M/month) for experienced drivers in HCMC
- Legal compliance mandates minimum wage protection for all employees[^3][^1]


### Industry Challenges

- Fixed salary structures reduce driver motivation and productivity
- Average drivers in logistics earn VND 5-15M/month depending on experience
- Performance-based pay is becoming standard practice in transportation companies[^4][^5]


## Proposed Salary Structure

### **Two-Component System**

**Component 1: Base Salary (Minimum Wage Compliance)**

- Monthly guaranteed minimum: VND 4,960,000 (legal requirement)
- Provides financial security and legal compliance
- Covers basic living standards regardless of performance

**Component 2: Progressive Trip Incentive Structure**


| Trip Level | Rate per Trip | Cumulative Earnings |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Trips 1-2/day** | VND 100,000 | Base productivity |
| **Trips 3-4/day** | VND 150,000 | Enhanced rate |
| **Trips 5+/day** | VND 200,000 | Premium performance |

**Monthly Example Calculations:**

- **Minimum Performance** (2 trips/day): Base VND 4,960,000 + VND 6,000,000 = **VND 10,960,000**
- **Good Performance** (3 trips/day): Base + VND 9,000,000 = **VND 13,960,000**
- **Excellent Performance** (4+ trips/day): Base + VND 12,000,000+ = **VND 16,960,000+**


## Business Benefits

### **Productivity Gains**

- **Guaranteed minimum 2 trips/day** vs current unpredictable performance
- Progressive rates incentivize drivers to exceed basic requirements
- Higher earning potential attracts and retains quality drivers[^6][^7]


### **Cost Efficiency**

- Pay directly correlates with revenue-generating activities
- Eliminates paying full wages for low productivity periods
- Self-regulating system where high performers earn more, low performers earn minimum


### **Operational Advantages**

- **Predictable service levels**: Minimum 2 daily trips guaranteed
- **Scalable motivation**: Top performers naturally emerge and drive team standards
- **Reduced management oversight**: Financial incentives drive behavior automatically


## Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Pilot Program (Month 1-2)**

- Test with 5-10 volunteer drivers
- Monitor trip completion rates and driver satisfaction
- Adjust rates based on operational data


### **Phase 2: Full Rollout (Month 3)**

- Company-wide implementation
- Comprehensive driver training on new structure
- Clear communication of earning potential


### **Phase 3: Optimization (Month 4-6)**

- Fine-tune incentive rates based on performance data
- Additional bonuses for fuel efficiency, safety records, customer ratings


## Risk Mitigation

### **Legal Compliance**

- Base salary meets minimum wage requirements
- Clear documentation of voluntary overtime and performance pay
- Regular legal review to ensure continued compliance[^1]


### **Driver Retention**

- Higher earning potential than fixed salary competitors
- Performance recognition creates job satisfaction
- Clear advancement path based on merit


### **Quality Control**

- Safety bonuses to prevent reckless driving for more trips
- Customer satisfaction metrics tied to bonuses
- Regular vehicle maintenance requirements


## Financial Projections

**Current vs Proposed Structure:**

- **Current cost**: Fixed VND 8M/driver/month (estimated)
- **Proposed average**: VND 11-14M/driver/month based on performance
- **Revenue increase**: 30-50% more trips completed daily
- **ROI timeline**: Break-even within 3 months through increased productivity[^8]


## Conclusion \& Next Steps

This performance-based structure addresses the core motivation issue while ensuring legal compliance and operational efficiency. The progressive incentive model naturally drives drivers toward higher productivity levels, directly benefiting company revenue and driver satisfaction.

**Immediate Actions Required:**

1. Board approval for pilot program
2. HR department preparation of contracts and policies
3. Driver communication and training program launch
4. Performance tracking system implementation

The structure transforms driver compensation from a fixed cost to a variable investment that scales with business performance, creating a win-win scenario for both drivers and company profitability.
